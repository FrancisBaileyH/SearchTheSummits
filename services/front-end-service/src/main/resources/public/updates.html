        <ul>
          <li>Sorting by date or relevance is now available! Click the handy drop down above your search results to change how the results are sorted</li>
          <li>Please be aware that when sorting by date, the date takes priority over relevance and so less relevant results may appear first</li>
          <li>I'm making good progress on image indexing. As we speaking over 60,000 images are stored in the system. The next steps are enabling search from the webiste, so stay tuned.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>February 20th, 2023</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Page date guessing is now live!</li>
          <li>All existing pages are being re-indexed as we speak and the new date guesser is being applied. This will allow users to sort the search results by most recent if they so choose. Please note that the date is a best guess and that not all pages have enough information to make a guess</li>
          <li>Once a sufficient number of pages are re-indexed I will enable/expose a dropdown to sort by date or relevance, so stay tuned!</li>
          <li>I have also completed work on internal tooling to make it easier to sift through and organize new sites my crawler discovers.</li>
          <li>Image searching is now in the works!</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>February 13th, 2023</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed bug where queries with a hyphen produced no results. E.g. <em>"pan-dome"</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>February 10th, 2023</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>PDF Indexing is now Supported! Select sites such as <a href="http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/" target="_blank">alpinejournal.org.uk</a> now have their PDF documents indexed</li>
          <li>This paves the way for indexing many other alpine journals. Most notably the Canadian Alpine Journal, once their service is back online</li>
          <li>Try this <a href="https://searchthesummits.com/?query=The+Ascent%20of%20Rondoy" target="_blank">query</a> out to see an example PDF</li>
          <li>We have now also reached over <strong>197,000</strong> pages indexed!</li>
          <li>I have made some improvements on the backend to determine when a query returns no results. I will use this to find new sources to ensure parity with Google and other sites</li>
          <li>Lastly, progress is slow on the sort by date feature. It's a tricky problem to solve when using heuristics to determine the date a page was created.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>February 3rd, 2023</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://peakbagger.com" target="_blank">peakbagger.com</a> trip reports are now being indexed! Only trip reports with a minimum number of words will be indexed to avoid empty reports</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where a search term that only matched the page title resulted in an empty search result being displayed</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where thumbnails were deleted whenever a page was re-indexed</li>
          <li>I'm going to focus on sorting by date/relevance next as that has been a big ask</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>January 26th, 2023</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>SearchTheSummits now supports thumbnails in search results! Try this <a href="https://searchthesummits.com/?query=relay+mountain" target="_blank">search</a></li>
          <li>In an effort to enrich the search experience, I've been busy working on image indexing logic</li>
          <li>Pages which have an appropriate display image will now have a thumbnail displayed next to the corresponding search result. The web crawler must re-index all existing pages, in order for thumbnails to be created, so it will take some time. The most recently indexed pages will have thumnbails already.</li>
          <li>This is a precursor to image searching, which I am evaluating and potentially implementing in the near future</li>
          <li>My next step is to add support for <a href="https://peakbagger.com" target="_blank">peakbagger.com's</a> selected trip reports and fix some minor bugs</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>January 15th, 2023</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Search the summits reached over <strong>100,000</strong> web pages indexed from a starting point of just 50,000 a week prior</li>
          <li>Added support for <a href="https://www.nwhikers.net/forums/" target="_blank">NWHikers.net forums</a>. Their posts are now searchable!</li>
